	<p>Of late, sound or noise pollution has adversely affected our normal life in a major way. It is chasing us at almost every step. In schools, colleges, offices, and even hospitals we have an explosion of deafening sound. There are many causes of sound pollution. We are almost deafened by the blaring mikes or the record players which are often played at full volume. Secondly, we have noise pollution caused by impatient automobiles always honking their horns. During some social and religious festivals, crackers are burst indiscriminately. In recent times laws have been passed to take effective steps to control noise pollution.</p>

	<p>My favourite hobby is gardening. I started it when I was only ten. I dig the land, sow the seeds, and water the plants in my garden. Every afternoon I work for an hour in my garden and watch the buds come up and the branches nod in the breeze. Although a hobby is a source of pleasure and not of profit, my hobby combines the two. My mother looks upon it very kindly, as a part of my garden serves as a kitchen garden. A hobby is an index to a manâ€™s character and I believe my hobby reflects my character.s</p>
